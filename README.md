# CIS221-Course---My-Analytics-Application-Experience-
This repository contains my reflections and midterm Jupyter Notebook exercises for CIS221 Analytics Application.

### 3.1. What are the challenges I experienced in doing Exploratory Data Analysis, Inferential Regression Analysis, and Regression for Machine Learning? 
In working through Exploratory Data Analysis, Inferential Regression Analysis, and Regression for Machine Learning, I realized that one of my biggest challenges was staying fully focused and confident while handling concepts that required deeper analytical thinking. Earlier in the course, I already struggled with foundational ideas such as data frames, supervised vs. unsupervised learning, and the role of KPIs. These gaps naturally made it harder for me to approach more advanced tasks like analyzing patterns, selecting variables, or interpreting regression outputs. There were also moments when I hesitated to participate in class discussions, especially when I missed opportunities simply because I was multitasking. These small moments contributed to a larger feeling of uncertainty when actually performing EDA or regression techniques.

### 3.2. What could have been the reasons why such an event happened? (you could bring in some theory into it). What are the things we have learned so that we can improve from this experience? 
Looking back, I can see clear reasons why these challenges happened. One reason is that analytics requires a different mindset—one that involves systems thinking, reflection, and understanding how different components interact. According to systems thinking theory, a problem cannot be isolated from the whole; everything is connected. So when I was not fully grounded on the basics, the more complex steps naturally became difficult. Another reason is cognitive overload. Trying to learn too many concepts at once, especially while handling external distractions, made it harder to retain information or apply it properly. These experiences taught me that effective analysis needs attention, mental presence, and a structured way of thinking. Tools like 5W1H, cause-and-effect analysis, and strategic alignment between KPIs and goals are not just class topics—they are frameworks that help organize my thoughts and prevent confusion.

From this experience, I learned the importance of being intentional with my learning. I need to pause, reflect, and understand the “why” behind each step instead of rushing through tasks. I also learned that participating in class is not just about earning points—it reinforces understanding and builds confidence. Most importantly, I now see that analytics is not just technical; it also demands discipline, focus, and curiosity.

### 3.3. Now what do I need to do better next time?
Moving forward, I need to do better by giving my full attention during lessons and avoiding multitasking so I won’t miss opportunities to learn or contribute. I also need to strengthen my foundation by reviewing key concepts regularly, especially variable identification, KPI structures, and the logic behind regression. Practicing more hands-on analysis will also help me become more comfortable with identifying patterns and choosing the right models. Lastly, I want to apply systems thinking more consistently by stepping back, looking at the whole picture, and reflecting before making conclusions. These steps will help me grow not only in analytics but also in developing better habits as a learner.
